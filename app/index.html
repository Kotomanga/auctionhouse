    <h1>AuctionHouse</h1>
    <h2>Decentralized Asset Auctions</h2>
    <p>Auctionhouse is a decentralized application (Dapp) that lets
    users auction off non-fungible on-chain assets. What does this
      mean?  When you have fungible assets like Augur REP tokens, you
    can easily sell them on an exchange since they're all
    interchangeable. But when you have a token that represents
    something one-of-a-kind, something unique, it's better served to
    auction it off, since there's no liquidity on exchanges for these
      one off items. Examples of things you can auction include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A domain name in the Ethereum Name Service
	(auctionhouse.address)</li>
	<li>An on chain virtual good (the powerful sword in an
	  Ethereum based RPG)</li>
	<li>A real world good represented by a token on the blockchain
	  (a concert ticket)</li>
      <li>A large block of tokens sellable at once</li>
      <li>A token that represents a role in an on-chain economy</li>
      <li>Read more about what you can auction and how it works in our
      <a href="about.html">about page</a>.</li>
    </ul>
